In the recent past, the industry of wealth management has seen a lot of growth. Every individual or business actively searches for opportunities to get the maximum returns. 
However, in most of the cases, they either lack the skills to identify the right investment opportunity, or there is a shortage of time for finding these opportunities. 
Hence, this gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission - Portfolio managers.    
A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. 
They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realise the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. 
They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments along with the right allocation. 
However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms. 
Therefore, the portfolio manager has to use the available resources to provide the best solution to the investor.     
Consider yourself working for an associate at an investment firm that manages accounts for private clients. 
Your role requires you to analyse a portfolio of stocks to provide consultation on investment management based on client’s requirement. 
Let us hear more about it from Joydeep as he introduces you to the entire case.

Your task is to provide consultation to two different investors, Mr Patrick Jyenger and Mr Peter Jyenger based on their requirements and financial objectives. 
You can refer to the elements mentioned in the video to develop the investor persona. The image below summarises the profile of the two investors:

Following points summarise the expected tasks in the assignment:

You must use the elements of technical analysis to understand the trend of the underlying stocks. The metrics associated with risk and returns must help you realise whether the security meets the criteria of your investor’s financial goals.
You must use the metrics and the visualisations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio.
After the selection of stocks, the portfolio must be validated using the active investment strategy to estimate the prices in future. You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals set by the investor.
The next segment will help you with each task in detail.
